# ATM-Interface
This is a simple ATM interface. There are no current quality controls in this application. The 
applications accepts your name, and then presents you with options regarding your bank account.


The classes are as follows:
1) Main - this is where the program begins. I kept the code in the Main class as minimal as possible.
2) BankAccountInfo - this contains information normally associated with a bank account: Name and Balance. 
There are various methods for whether or not a user wants to add, withdraw, or check balance.
3) GUI - The first GUI is a welcome screen that accepts your name, then calls another GUI method to
access your bank account and displays request information.
